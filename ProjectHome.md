"**SteadyCrypt** is a java-based open source encryption tool for **quickly encrypting confidential files** to prevent unauthorized usage. As far as features, tools and encryption algorithm are concerned, it is not comparable to widely used TrueCrypt, but users who wont like to follow lengthy procedure in TrueCrypt to create encrypted containers, will find it useful. Being a java-based application, it can work on any OS platform where JRE is installed. Moreover, it supports simple drag & drop behavior to specify folders and files which are to be encrypted. The encrypted containers are secured with a master password which has to entered after installing the application."
